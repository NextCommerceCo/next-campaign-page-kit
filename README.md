# Next Campaign Page Kit

Next Campaign Page Kit is a tool for building campaign funnels that can be hosted with any of your favorite static site hosting providers such as Netlify or Cloudflare Pages. 

## Motivation

Most static site generators are designed around a single site. When you need to manage multiple campaign funnels in one repository, you quickly run into problems: shared layouts bleed across campaigns, assets collide, and a change to one campaign can silently break another.

Next Campaign Page Kit solves this by treating each campaign as a fully isolated unit within a single repository. Every campaign lives in its own subdirectory with its own layouts, assets, and configuration — but they're all built, versioned, and deployed together.

The CLI tools (`dev`, `clone`, `config`, `compress`) and template filters (`campaign_asset`, `campaign_link`, `campaign_include`) enforce this isolation at every step, so developers can work on one campaign without fear of affecting another.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a project directory

```bash
mkdir my-campaigns && cd my-campaigns
```

### 2. Initialize and install

```bash
npm init -y
npm install next-campaign-page-kit
```

### 3. Run the setup script

```bash
npx campaign-init
```

This will:
- Add all CLI scripts to your `package.json`
- Create `_data/campaigns.json` — empty campaign registry to get you started

### 4. Add your first campaign to `_data/campaigns.json`

```json
{
  "campaigns": [
    {
      "name": "My Campaign",
      "slug": "my-campaign",
      "description": "My first campaign",
      "sdk_version": "0.3.10"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Create your campaign files

```
src/
└── my-campaign/
    ├── _layouts/
    │   └── base.html
    ├── assets/
    │   └── config.js
    └── presale.html
```

### 6. Set your Campaign API key

```bash
npm run config
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Get your Campaign API key from the Campaigns App in your store. See [Campaigns App Guide](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/#getting-started).

### 7. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
1. Show a list of available campaigns
2. Let you select which campaign to preview
3. Start the dev server
4. Open your browser to the selected campaign

### Key Files

- **`_data/campaigns.json`** - Register all campaigns and their configuration data here
- **`src/[campaign]/_layouts/base.html`** - Campaign's base layout
- **`src/[campaign]/assets/config.js`** - Campaign Cart SDK configuration

## Page Frontmatter

Each campaign page uses YAML frontmatter to configure the page for context.

### Page Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `page_layout` | string | No | Layout file in `_layouts/`. Defaults to `base.html` |
| `title` | string | Yes | Page title for `<title>` tag |
| `page_type` | string | Yes | Page type: `product`, `checkout`, `upsell`, `receipt` |
| `permalink` | string | No | Custom URL path (e.g., `/starter/`) |
| `next_success_url` | string | No | Redirect URL after successful checkout |
| `next_upsell_accept` | string | No | URL when upsell accepted |
| `next_upsell_decline` | string | No | URL when upsell declined |
| `styles` | array | No | Page-specific CSS files (relative paths or external URLs) |
| `scripts` | array | No | Page-specific JS files (relative paths or external URLs) |
| `footer` | boolean | No | Show footer on this page |


### Example

```yaml
---
page_layout: base.html
title: Checkout
page_type: checkout
next_success_url: upsell.html
styles:
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.css
  - css/offer.css
scripts:
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.js
  - js/offer.js
footer: true
---
```


## Campaign Context (`campaign`)

Each page automatically has access to its campaign's data from `_data/campaigns.json` via the `campaign` object. This allows you to provide configured context directly to your pages.

### Usage

You can access any key defined in your campaign's entry in `_data/campaigns.json`:

```liquid
<h1>{{ campaign.name }}</h1>
<p>Contact: {{ campaign.support_email }}</p>
```

### Adding Custom Context

To add more context across all pages in your campaign, simply add new keys to your campaign in `_data/campaigns.json`:

```json
{
  "campaigns": [
    {
      "slug": "starter",
      "name": "Starter Campaign",
      "support_email": "support@example.com",
      "custom_headline": "Welcome to our Store!"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then the context is available to use it in your templates:

```liquid
<h2>{{ campaign.custom_headline }}</h2>
```

### Layout Resolution

Layouts are automatically resolved to the campaign's `_layouts/` directory:

- `page_layout: base.html` → `starter/_layouts/base.html`
- `page_layout: custom.html` → `starter/_layouts/custom.html`

**No layout specified?** Defaults to `base.html`.

## Template Tags (Filters)

Templates use [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) syntax. Next Campaign Page Kit provides additional custom filters and tags for campaign-relative includes, assets, and links.

> [!TIP]
> Use campaign template filters to ensure your includes, assets, and links are automatically handled when cloning templates to a fresh new campaign.

### `campaign_asset`

Resolves asset paths to the current campaign.

**Syntax:**
```liquid
{{ 'filename' | campaign_asset }}
```

**Examples:**
```liquid
<!-- Config -->
<script src="{{ 'config.js' | campaign_asset }}"></script>
<!-- Output: /starter/config.js -->

<!-- CSS -->
<link href="{{ 'css/custom.css' | campaign_asset }}" rel="stylesheet">
<!-- Output: /starter/css/custom.css -->

<!-- Images -->
<img src="{{ 'images/logo.png' | campaign_asset }}" alt="Logo">
<!-- Output: /starter/images/logo.png -->
```

**Use for:** CSS files, JavaScript files, images, config.js, any campaign asset.

---

### `campaign_link`

Generates clean URLs for inter-page navigation.

**Syntax:**
```liquid
{{ 'filename.html' | campaign_link }}
```

**Examples:**
```liquid
<!-- Navigation link -->
<a href="{{ 'checkout.html' | campaign_link }}">Checkout</a>
<!-- Output: /starter/checkout/ -->

<!-- Campaign Cart meta tag -->
<meta name="next-success-url" content="{{ next_success_url | campaign_link }}">
<!-- Output: /starter/upsell/ -->

<!-- Data attribute -->
<button data-next-url="{{ 'upsell.html' | campaign_link }}">Continue</button>
<!-- Output: /starter/upsell/ -->
```

**Features:**
- Removes `.html` extension
- Adds trailing slash
- Prepends campaign slug
- Handles anchor links (`#section`) and absolute URLs

**Use for:** Page links, navigation URLs, redirect URLs, Campaign Cart SDK meta tags.

---

### `campaign_include`

Includes a file relative to the current campaign's `_includes` directory. This is useful for including reusable components that are specific to a campaign.

**Syntax:**
```liquid
{% campaign_include 'filename.html' arg=value %}
```

**Examples:**
```liquid
<!-- Include a slider component -->
{% campaign_include 'slider.html' images=slider_images %}

<!-- Include with parameters -->
{% campaign_include 'slider.html' images=slider_images show_package_image=true %}
```

**Use for:** Reusable components within a campaign (e.g., sliders, testimonials).

## Connecting to Campaigns App

To connect this campaign to your 29 Next Campaigns App:

1. Run `npm run config`
2. Select your campaign
3. Enter your API key from the Campaigns App
4. Deploy your campaign

For more details, see the [Campaigns App documentation](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/#getting-started).

## Test Orders

You can use our [test cards](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/admin-api/guides/testing-guide/) to create test orders.

## Compress Images

Compress all images in a campaign directory in-place. Supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF. Only overwrites a file if the compressed output is smaller than the original.

```bash
npm run compress
```

This will:
1. Show a list of available campaigns
2. Let you select which campaign to compress
3. Compress all images found anywhere in the campaign directory (`src/[campaign]/`)
4. Print a before/after table with file sizes and total savings

**Preview mode** — see what would be saved without modifying any files:

```bash
npm run compress:preview
```

Example output:

```
◇  Found 3 images
◇  2 images ready to compress
